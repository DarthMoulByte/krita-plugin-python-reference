# Krita Python Reference Plugin

A Krita plugin that displays a searchable overview of the Python API.

The reference is built at run time via Python's introspection abilities and hence always matching your Krita version. Since the API doesn't expose any doc strings or method signatures, this plugin can only list method names.
